# Notes:

"""
Pythos is strongly but dynamically typed
Functions are defined with def keyword.
Variables types are, int, float, double, boolean, String (char arrays)
Everything is an object.
Pass by value if the variable has a value but pass by object, the variable is an object.
Classes has self keyword, and class method's first argument is self always.
Has representation constructs called comprehension, which is like map and grep in perl.
In built data structures:
- list()   - arrays,
- set()    - unordered arrays with unique values
- dict()   - hashes
- tuples() - const arrays - cannot change values

Generators - can iterate through the values one at at time
Null in other languages is None.
Bare string is true.
No do while loop, no ++ use += instead, no semicolon, space indendation.
Lots of __xxx__ values, called dunder. 
Single line comment is with # sign and multiline with "\" ".
Supports one line function pointer called, lambda => lambda x: x*2
Command line arugments are args and *kwargs
Comes with standard library like stdio.h in C.
Type casting is done with (), e.g. list() or set() etc.
